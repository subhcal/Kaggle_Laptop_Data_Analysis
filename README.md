# Kaggle_Laptop_Data_Analysis
This project analyzes laptop sales data from Kaggle......

This repository contains a data analysis project on Laptop Data sourced from Kaggle. The project involves cleaning and processing the dataset, followed by visualizing key insights using Tableau.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze laptop sales data to understand market trends and product performance across different companies. The analysis focuses on:

- Company-wise sales
- Type Name-wise sales
- Combined Company and Type Name sales to evaluate market superiority
- Average product price company-wise

## Data Processing

The raw dataset was first cleaned and preprocessed with the following steps:

- Removed unwanted columns that do not contribute to the analysis
- Dropped duplicate records to ensure data integrity
- Handled null values by removing or imputing as appropriate

This preprocessing ensures the dataset is clean and ready for accurate analysis and visualization.

## Visualization

Tableau was used to create interactive dashboards and visualizations including:

- **Company Wise Sale:** Displays total sales volume per laptop manufacturer
- **Type Name Wise Sale:** Shows sales distribution by laptop type/model
- **Company's TypeName Sale:** Combines company and type name sales to highlight market superiority of specific products within each company
- **Average Product Price Company Wise:** Compares average laptop prices across different companies

These visualizations provide valuable insights into market trends and product positioning.
